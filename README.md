# BRFSS Data Analysis — CSULB AI x Data Event

This notebook was created as part of CSULB’s **AI x Data** event, held on Saturday, March 8th. Over the course of the day (8 AM–10 PM), we explored and analyzed data from the **Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)**, focusing on public health trends in the United States from **2011 to 2023**.

## About the Data

- Obesity  
- Physical activity  
- Nutrition

We used this data to identify trends and segment populations based on behavior and risk factors.

## What the Notebook Covers

- Data cleaning and preparation  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering techniques  
- K-means clustering for population segmentation  
- Visualizations to highlight key patterns and trends

## Tools Used
